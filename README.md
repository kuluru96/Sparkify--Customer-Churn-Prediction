# Sparkify:Customer-Churn-Prediction


## Project Motivation
This project is a part of Data Scientist Nano degree program offered by Udacity. In this project, I am trying to predict the  customer churn for a music streaming company: Sparkify. This project involves:

 - Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB) 
 - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand what features are useful for predicting churn
 - Feature Engineering to create features 
 - Modelling algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes 

## Packages and Libraries
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - PySpark SQL
 - PySpark ML 


## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work in predicting churn with  markdown cells throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available 
A Random Forest Classifier was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.77. 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
I'd like to acknowledge Udacity for the project idea and workspace.
